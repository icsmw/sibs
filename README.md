`sibs` (Simple Build Script) is a scripting language designed for writing concise scripts focused on build operations. The key features of the project are its cross-platform and portable nature (it is intended to always be a single binary file), as well as a set of tools that simplify common tasks.

The project is currently in an early stage of development.
