## Developing plan
- support of comments "//"
- support of tokens extracting
- define tasks as allowed in parallel
- add test for error: command in root level of scenario
- FIRST is missed in block
- catch errors in concating strings like $d = "bla${a}bla"; (should be "bla{$a}bla")
- support modules for functions grouping; like @os.get
- add simple assignation $a = $b
- add web-server for remote access
- finish function token implementation for feeding
