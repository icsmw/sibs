- [done] Update all `LinkedErr` to use trait `SrcLinking`;
- [done] Check `ufns`, `efns` to reuse same code parts
- [done] Add to Ty - enum AllowedFor { Task, Func }
- all loops and iterators (while, loop, for) and recursion should have global limit for iterations number
- "if" statement without "else" should return "Indeterminate" type, but not type infered from "block"
